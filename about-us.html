                <p>On behalf of the head of state, construction of a Republican Clinical Hospital with 240 beds began in Nur-Sultan. The facility was built by the British company Fitzpatrick Contractors in the likeness of the royal clinic in England.</p>
                <p>The opening took place in September 2001. Since that time, the status of the clinic has changed twice: from the Republican Clinical Hospital - to the RGP (2003), then to the Darina Scientific Medical Center JSC (2010).</p>
                <p>Since 2005, JSC “DMC” has been the headquarters of the Euro-Asian Respiratory Society (EARO). Thanks to these activities, in 2007 Kazakhstan became a member of the Global Alliance to Fight Respiratory Diseases (GARD), a division of the World Health Organization. In October 2007, the Health Assembly Foundation, with the support of WHO and the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, awarded JSC DMC the title of laureate of the International Prize in the category “For Contribution to Health Development.”</p>
                <p>Implementing strategic goals to reduce mortality from diseases of the circulatory system, since 2009 the center has coordinated all cardiology and cardiac surgery services in the country. Employees of JSC "NNMC" contributed to the opening of cardiac centers in all regions of Kazakhstan and in two large cities - in Nur-Sultan and Almaty, transferring high technologies and training personnel for new clinics. Our center’s specialists have developed and implemented standards for the management of patients with acute coronary syndrome.</p>
                <p>Since 2012, JSC DMC has been performing organ and cell transplantation operations; by decision of the FDA, our center was included in the database of safe clinics for conducting international research. Understanding the importance of providing quality medical services, JSC DMC strives to become competitive in the global market and meet all international quality standards in its field, developing and constantly improving the management system. In June 2010, JSC "DMC" was certified to the level of "Recognized Excellence - 4 stars", and in November 2012 - to the level of "Recognized Excellence - 5 stars" of the <strong>European Foundation for Quality Management (EFQM) model</strong>.</p>
                <p>In addition, JSC NSMC has implemented international standards for diagnostic laboratories: <strong>external quality assessment EQAS from BIO-Rad (USA)</strong>, national accreditation standards for medical organizations. The center was one of the first to receive a certificate with a result of 98.7% compliance of medical services according to the accreditation standards of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan.</p>

                <p>In 2010, a telemedicine department was opened, which expanded the geography of the partnership, and in 2011, corporate social responsibility was introduced.</p>
                <p>In 2010, the European Business Community and the European Union Chamber of Commerce and Industry recognized JSC DMC as the <strong>“Best European Enterprise in the Field of Medicine”</strong> and awarded the corresponding diploma. In 2012, JSC DMC became the winner of the <strong>Asian Quality Award (ANQ, Hong Kong)</strong>, in 2014 it was awarded <strong>the Paryz Award</strong> for the introduction of new technologies in the field of medicine, <strong>the European Award for Best Practice (Brussels)</strong> and <strong>the European Award for Quality (Italy)</strong>. In the same year, the center’s specialists presented new research on the use of HIFU therapy in the treatment of parasitic diseases of internal organs and received <strong>the European Award for Quality Innovation</strong>.</p>
                <p>The center develops and implements the most relevant areas of healthcare and medical science in Kazakhstan. The use of transplantation of various types of stem cells within the framework of highly specialized medical care makes it possible to solve complex problems in the clinic of internal medicine and surgery.
